AI/FuzzyLogic version 0.03
==========================

       Performs all basic and some advanced operations on Fuzzy
       Sets. Use English-like, intentionally vague objects repre-
       senting concepts with which to make inferences. The infer-
       ences might be approximate reasoning about precise knowl-
       edge, or precise reasoning about approximate knowledge.
       This vagueness allows the capture and application of human
       expert knowledge.

       Overloads Perl operators to perform operations on Fuzzy
       Sets.

       Few good introducts to Fuzzy Logic exist. If you find one,
       let me know, and I'll recommend it, but I've yet to find a
       general introduction that introduces the idea, provides a
       sample implemenation, and shows how to use the idea and
       implementation to solve problems. So, part of the official
       goal of this project is to introduce Fuzzy Logic to the
       novice and get her up and running and productive.

       Other Fuzzy Modules
       ----- ----- -------

       AI::FuzzyInference, AI::Fuzzy. We don't attempt to provide
       a structure for building inference chains - that is left
       to regular perl code using overloaded operators, "if"
       statements, and the like. We also define a larger set of
       operations, introduce sets-of-sets and combinational, per-
       mutational behavior for working on them. AI::Fuzzy doesn't
       fit with what my understanding of Fuzzy Logic is. Sorry,
       Tom. See "Collaboration" in the BUGS section.

       Extensible framework. Modules in this distribution may be
       subclassed to define new Fuzzy operations, combinational
       behaviors, and other features. Extensions may be added to
       this distribute (if I like them), or you may distribute
       them seperately, with this module as a dependency.
